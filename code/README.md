# Multitenant Web Store code
Code split into three modules

- Front end: visualization of the web
- Back end: code running in the server, the front end will use it as an API.
- Orchestra: all continuous integration & delivery stuff (Jenkins pipelines) and Kubernetes configuration for module communication.
