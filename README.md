# Multitenant web store

This project is my Master's Thesis at Universidad de Granada.
There is a study of multi-tenancy in Cloud computing, its implications and trade-offs.
Multi-tenancy is a property of a system where multiple customers, so-called tenants, transparently share the systemâ€™s resources.

A general multi-tenant web store is implemented.
Businesses can use this system to create an online e-commerce adapted to their needs.

A Colored Petri Net, a mathematical model of the system, is included to extract conclusions about their properties.
